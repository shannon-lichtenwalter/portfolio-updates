        <p>I may have put away my stethoscope but I still strive to fulfill my passion of enhancing people’s lives and
          well-being. It looks a little different these days, but now I am working towards that same goal through the
          creation and development of high-quality programs and applications.</p>

        <p>I worked as an RN in Pediatric Oncology and Pulmonary hospital units for 5 years prior to discovering a
          passion
          and fascination for coding. I value my years as a nurse as it afforded me opportunities to work as part of a
          team in high stress situations and sharpened my critical thinking and problem solving skills. I have always
          been
          drawn to working with technology and computers, so now I am taking my skills and strengths from the hospital
          bedside to my local text editor.</p>
        <p>Web
          and software development is a field that inspires and motivates me to learn. I have become addicted to that
          feeling of magic when a program or app successfully runs. It makes the world feel bigger and full of
          possibilities and reminds me that there are no limits to what can be created through code. I am currently enrolled in the Engineering Immersion program at Thinkful. Once finished, I look forward to being on
          the front lines of an actively evolving field where I can problem solve, work creatively, and continue to grow my skills. </p>
